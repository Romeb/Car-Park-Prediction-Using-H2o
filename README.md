# Car-Park-Prediction-Using-H2o

A machine learning model was built using the open-source machine learning library h2o â€” the project aimed to predict the occupancy rate in car parks in Birmingham. The dataset consisted of over 1,000,000 observations, but I reduced the dataset down to only focus on one car park in Birmingham due to computational power. I took a classification approach by creating a new variable called class, that will set the occupancy rate to either, low, medium or high. This new class variable was the target variable. 

The reason I've chosen to use h2o compared to other machine learning tools is due to its speed and scalability. H2o is designed to produce much faster performance. The main benefit I've found in using h2o is its ability to perform parameter tuning and variable importance, this has saved me a lot of time in finding the best parameters.

In my code, I have placed comments to allow you to replicate the steps I have taken quickly. 

Thank you for taking the time in viewing my project.
